# Weather Data to AWS S3 - Day 01 of the 30-Day DevOps Challenge  

Welcome to Day 01 of the **#DevOpsAllStarChallenge**! This project demonstrates how to build a Python application that fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeather API and stores it in an AWS S3 bucket. It's a simple yet effective way to kickstart cloud-based storage workflows while managing data dependencies with a virtual environment.  

## Features  
- Fetch real-time weather data using the OpenWeather API.  
- Store weather data securely in an AWS S3 bucket.  
- Ensure unique bucket names with random number generation for naming.  

## Prerequisites  
Before running this project, make sure you have the following:  
- Python 3.8+ installed  
- An OpenWeather API key (sign up [here](https://openweathermap.org/api))  
- AWS CLI configured with an IAM user having S3 permissions ([Set up AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html))  

## Setup and Installation  

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/Xaidor/weather-data-to-s3.git
   cd Weather-Dashboard
